MSP solution for the Intel Acceler8 2011 contest
================================================

BUILDING
--------
The solution can be easily built using `make` command. There are several
targets for building, among which there are only two interesting.  The first
is 'retail' which actually is the one you need to run against the test cases.
Another one is 'optimized' which is pretty similar to 'retail' but has no any
parallelization inside. Thus if you are going to test my solution just run
`make retail` and then use created `out/msp_rtl`.

Full list of build targets:

* 'rtl': paralleled and optimized with `-O2`
* 'vec': vectorized and optimized with `-O2`
* 'xtm': vectorized and optimized with `-O3`
* 'omp': paralleled but not optimized
* 'sse': vectorized single-threaded
* 'dbg': single-threaded with debug symbols

RUNNING
-------
According to the contest rules the program takes two command-line arguments:
input file name and output file name. If there is not enough arguments the
program will exit with the status code "1".

UTILITIES
---------
The distribution archive includes some utils for test automation and
perfomance analysis. Also there is a script generating report, it requires
`gnuplot'.
